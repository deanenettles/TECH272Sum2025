When starting up for class:

1) Copy your website folder into the Local folder (so it won't get lost if the system crashes)

2) Go to the Apple menu, go to System Settings, scroll down and select Mouse; then select Mighty Mouse Settings, then for the right click change it from Primary Button to Secondary Button. 

2) Go to Finder. Go to Finder > Settings. Click on Advanced and turn on "Show all filename extensions"

3) Open Photoshop and log in to Adobe Creative Cloud.

4) Open Dreamweaver

5) In Dreamweaver, go to Sites > Manage Sites, create a new site, name it TECH272, and select the website folder on your Local Drive for the Local Site Folder and click Save.
