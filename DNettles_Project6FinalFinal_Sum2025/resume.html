                    <h3>Resume</h3>
                    <p>Deane Nettles is a graphic designer, photographer, and illustrator. He has an MFA in Integrated Design from the University of Baltimore and has taught at numerous colleges and universities in the DC/Baltimore area.</p>

                    <p>He began on a college newspaper as a photographer and learned production and designing on the grid. He received his undergraduate degree in news journalism. Then he went back for a degree in advertising design while editing the same student paper. The former editor of the newspaper got him a position working as a production artist at boutique agency Morgan Burchette; from there he became art director at KSK&nbsp;Communications.</p>

                    <p>Since then he has freelanced for ad agencies, design studios and direct marketing firms. He has been art director at several publications and senior art director at August, Lang &amp;&nbsp;Husak, who he still manages projects for.</p>

                    <p>He is a past president and life member of the Art Directors Club of Metropolitan Washington where he ran the Annual Show and produced programs and workshops.</p>

                    <p>He has been teaching since 2006 and has taught courses in design, illustration and web design and advanced courses in typography, advertising and branding.</p>

                    <p>Deane is always looking to work with an energetic, committed team like the one on his college newspaper — teams told to quiet down by the classes next door and happy to continue their enthusiastic arguments over pizzas after hours.</p>

                    <p>In addition he is currently learning type design and javascript; is married with a wife, a dog and a cat; draws, paints and sculpts; bikes over a thousand miles a year; and dances swing, waltz, blues and zydeco.</p>
